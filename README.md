## üìÇ Project Structure

The project follows a standard Next.js App Router structure with some key directories:

-   `src/app/(main)`: Contains the core, authenticated pages of the application (Dashboard, Chat, Settings).
-   `src/app/(public)`: Contains public-facing pages like the landing page.
-   `src/components`: Shared UI components used across the application.
-   `src/ai/flows`: The heart of the AI logic. All Genkit flows are defined here.
-   `src/ai/tools`: Custom tools that Genkit flows can use (e.g., fetching URLs, parsing data).
-   `src/services`: Server-side actions for interacting with Firebase services (Firestore, Auth).
-   `src/lib`: Contains constants, utility functions, type definitions, and Firebase client/admin setup.
